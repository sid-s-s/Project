						will be decided by the lender. You can get an education loan for
						studies starting from Nursery. For higher studies, you can get a

						working professionals.</p></li>

					<p>Used Cars Loans. Banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies
						(NBFCs) offer used car loans for the purchase of a pre-owned or
						used car. Although the price of a used car is lower than a new
						car, used car loans have a higher interest rate and lower loan
						tenure compared to new car loans due to the age of the car. Banks
						offer used car loans up to 80-85% of the ex-showroom/on-road price
						of the car at 12-18% for a loan tenure of 1 to 5 years.</p></li>
